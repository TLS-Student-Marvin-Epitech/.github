# 🧪 Epitech Toulouse – Collaborative Automated Tests (Marvin-Like)

Welcome to the **Collaborative Automated Testing Platform** developed by and for **Epitech Toulouse** students.

> ⚡ **Think of this like a student-made version of Marvin** but instead of school imposed tests, **you write and share your own** to ensure quality and consistency in group or personal projects.

---

## 💡 What Is It?

This project is a **Jenkins-powered test automation platform** where **students create, share, and run automated tests** for their own repositories. It's collaborative, open to Epitech Toulouse students, and built to help you:

* Ensure your code works as expected
* Catch bugs early (before the TA does 😉)
* Practice professional CI/CD workflows
* Avoid “it works on my machine” problems

---

## 🔒 Access for Epitech Toulouse Students

> 🚨 **Access is restricted to Epitech Toulouse.**

If you’re a student and want to use this platform, you **must request access** from the CI admin team:

📧 **Contact:** `kevin.salanier@epitech.eu`

Once granted, you’ll receive:

* Jenkins credentials
* Setup instructions for integrating your project
* Guidelines for writing compatible tests

## 🤖 Why Use This Instead of Just Marvin?

| Marvin                 | This Platform                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Official Epitech tests | Student-written tests         |
| Static, often hidden   | Open, editable, collaborative |
| Black-box              | Transparent & customizable    |
| Limited use case       | Use for any project, any time |

> ⚠️ **Reminder: This platform is a student-led tool meant to help you test and improve your code. Marvin remains the official evaluation system.**

## ⚙️ How Jenkins Works

Every time you push code or open a pull request:

1. 🔄 **Code is pulled**
2. 🏗️ **Environment is set up**
3. 🧪 **All tests are run**
4. 📊 **Results are archived + reported**

You can view logs, failures, and test coverage from the Jenkins web UI.
